## 📌 Project Overview

This Power BI project presents a real-world analysis of inventory and supply chain management operations. It focuses on evaluating key metrics to uncover inefficiencies, optimize warehouse utilization, and improve stock management practices.

The dashboard is designed for stakeholders to monitor performance across inventory processes, understand backorder patterns, and assess how effectively the supply chain operates across regions and product categories.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To visualize and analyze inventory management KPIs and supply chain operations to:
- Ensure optimal warehouse space utilization
- Improve inventory turnover
- Reduce excess inventory holding periods
- Track lead time and backorder performance

---

## 📊 Key Metrics & KPIs

1. **Warehouse Utilization Rate**  
   Measures how much warehouse space is being used relative to its capacity.

2. **Days Sales of Inventory (DSI)**  
   Indicates the average number of days it takes to sell the current inventory on hand.

3. **Inventory Turnover Ratio**  
   Reflects how often inventory is sold and replenished over a specific period.

4. **Lead Time (Average by Category)**  
   Shows the average time taken to deliver a product after order placement.

5. **Backorder Count by Status**  
   Tracks the number of pending, fulfilled, and canceled orders.

6. **Inventory Level by Category and Region**  
   Helps identify stock distribution across different categories and geographic regions.

7. **Transportation Cost by Region and Category**  
   Displays spending patterns related to logistics by region.

## 💡 Insights Gained

- **Warehouse Utilization** is currently at 34%, indicating space may be underused.
- **DSI of 15.56** suggests moderate inventory holding duration — scope exists to optimize turnover.
- **Inventory Turnover Ratio** of 23.47 highlights efficient movement of stock.
- **West Region** shows relatively high transportation costs across categories.
- **Clothing and Furniture** categories have the longest lead times and highest inventory levels.
- **Most backorders** fall under the “Fulfilled” status, but delays may be explored further.
